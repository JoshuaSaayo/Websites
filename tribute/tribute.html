            <h2>Focalors's Archon Quests and History</h2>
            <ul id="tribute-info">
                <li><p><span class="bold">Appearance</span> - Focalors has the same appearance with Furina as the latter being her human vessel, except she wears a white dress with puffy long sleeves with gold accents and fades to a dark shade of blue. The center of the dress is reversed with the dark blue fading to white with gold accents and trims; the center exposes her neckline, chest and stomach while fastened by a gold and blue metal ornament.</p></li>
                <li><p><span class="bold">Focalors first moment upon instated as Hydro Archon</span> - Egeria, the previous Hydro Archon, was slain during the cataclysm, and Focalors was instated in her place as the Hydro Archon sometime afterward. Focalors herself was also an Oceanid who Egeria decided to be her successor when the time came. The Oceanids that did not assume a human form, including the strongest among them, Rhodeia of Loch, did not recognize Focalors as the new Hydro Archon, with Idyia noting that around the same time as her ascension, the very waters of Fontaine became filled with pain and hatred. This change, in addition to their discovery of what remained of their former god at the Harvisptokhm, led the Oceanids to exile themselves from Fontaine and cut all ties.</p></li>
                <li><p><span class="bold">Furina's first appearance </span> - Upon ascending, Focalors separated her divinity from her body and spirit; and named the human she left behind "Furina." Focalors saw Furina as essentially a human version of herself as well as exactly the kind of human she wished to be. Focalors kept her Gnosis in her divine half and hid inside the Oratrice Mecanique d'Analyse Cardinale, while tasking Furina with taking her place to deceive the masses in order to carry out her plan, as if her identity was revealed, her plan would fail and the prophecy would doom her people. To ensure this, Focalors placed a curse upon Furina, making her immortal as long as her divinity existed, but also preventing her from pursuing her own happiness. Furina was successful in duping the masses for 500 years, during which she used the acquired Indemnitium to forge a massive sword that she would use to kill her divinity with.</p></li>
                <li><p><span class="bold">Archon Quest Chapter III: Act V - Akasha Pulses, the Kalpa Flame Rises</span> - Nahida mentions that while Focalors doesn't directly preside over trials, she is still present and has the right to influence the final verdict. Focalors created the Oratrice Mecanique d'Analyse Cardinale, which was designed and meant to help the Iudex, Neuvillette, carry out sentences.</p></li>
                <li><p><span class="bold">The Truth of the Prophecy Slates</span> - Slates were discovered in a ruin near the Poisson. The slates depicted the prophecy from Celestia. The first slate depicts Egeria turning the Oceanids into humans through the use of the Primordial Seawater, which can be reversed by coming into contact with the water once again. The second slate is of Egeria begging the heavens for forgiveness but she was never forgiven. The third one depicts the people of Fontaine trying the Hydro Archon at the Court of Justice. The fourth one is of Furina weeping on her throne as everyone gets turned back into an oceanid by the Primordial Sea. The source of the Primordial Sea that will start the catastrophe is the All-Devouring Narwhal.</p></li>
                <li><p><span class="bold">Set Out to Deceive the Heavenly Principles</span> - After pondering about it at the bottom of the sea, Focalors decided that she must deceive the Heavenly Principles. Which means, she must allow the prophecy to happen to a certain extent and save everyone at the same time.</p></li>
                <li><p><span class="bold">Arlecchino's investigation</span> - Following Childe's disappearance in the Fortress of Meropide, Arlecchino decided to investigate Furina, eventually running into her by pure chance while she was trying to play with a cat, using the opportunity to attack and try to steal her Gnosis. She did not find the Gnosis on her, while Furina was left shocked and begged for mercy. Arlecchino felt a "curse" of some sort emanating from her, her genuine fear of death and eccentric behavior unfitting for an Archon. Arlecchino left without threatening any further harm, realizing that she was not Focalors and that the Gnosis was being held somewhere else.</p></li>
                <li><p><span class="bold">Focalors's sin</span> - Eventually, Focalors would be put on trial for the "original sin" that the Heavenly Principles had declared on Egeria. The Traveler and Neuvillette would eventually realize that Furina was a fraud, managing to put her on trial in an attempt to make her reveal her secrets as to avoid the prophecy. Now revealing her true identity, Focalors appeared to Neuvillette and admitted to having Furina take her place as the Hydro Archon for the past 500 years in order to successfully deceive the Heavenly Principles. She then reveals her plan to end herself at the hands of the Oratrice, thus returning her elemental authority to its rightful owner, Neuvillette, both out of guilt from acquiring his stolen power, and knowing that only him at his full dragonhood and the experiences he had with the people, would be able to save them from the prophecy.</p></li>
                <li><p><span class="bold">Hydro Archon's Execution</span> - Having acquired enough Indemnitium to carry out her sentence, she proceeded to execute herself. Her Gnosis was returned to Neuvillette; with his full Authority restored, he proceeded to absolve Fontanians of their sin, preventing them from dissolving, though any that dissolved prior to her sacrifice would not be returned. This self-sacrifice also shattered her Archon throne, resulting in six Archons remaining.</p></li>

        <p>My ideals have no stains. <br>
            I must correct you. People here bear no sins in the eyes of the gods... Only laws and the Tribunal can judge someone.<br>
            They can judge even me. So praise my magnificence and purity. <br>
